1. Word Squares
Given a set of words without duplicates, find all word squares you can build from them.
A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, 
where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).
For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both 
horizontally and vertically.
